Iteration 2:
    Major changes include the addition of allergy and lifestyle tags along with working persistence, 
    the ability to edit recipes, and Recipes no longer contain ingredients, but contain an object that
    holds and ingredient, an amount and a unit. One issue that we have not fixed is that we cannot edit
    the title of the recipe.
    
Iteration 3:
	Major UI changes to simplify layout. Added a new variable to recipe objects that would act as their primary key in the database to allow 
	the ability to edit recipe titles. Added full integration and acceptance tests as required.
