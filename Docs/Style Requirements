Style Requirements

Naming:

	- Capitalize classes
	- CamelCase
	- Verbs for function names
	
	Android:
		XML ID's : ID's should be of the format <ActivityName>_<ElementType>_<FunctionName>
			E.g.
				"@+id/recipeListActivity_editText_search"
				For an EditText in activity_recipe_list.xml that is used for recipe search.

Commenting:

	-Obscure code only
	
Spacing:

	- Always space after '.'
	- Always space after '(' and before ')'
	- Always newline after '{' and space before
	- Indentation should be 4 spaces
	
Bracing:

	- Open curly braces should be at the end of the line
	- Always use braces where applicable
	- Else if's should be between curly braces
	
	- When returning:
			//space
			return x;
		}

Misc:
	
	- Never use multiple return statements
	- Only use "break" with proper justification
	- Design with a fail fast philosophy; avoid in-code error checking
	- Topically and alphabetically organized
	- Order methods as so: Public, Private, Protected, Default
	- Order imports alphabetically
